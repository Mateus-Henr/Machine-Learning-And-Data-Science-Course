    "# Why to use NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy offers list functions and functions to convert data to machine language.\n",
    "- It's widely used due to the fact that it was written in C, and because of that performs better than Python's functions for operations on lists (since C is faster than Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy is a library that converts data to numbers, so that the comuter can interpret those numbers to find patterns.\n",
    "- It's also a Data Analysis tool.\n",
    "- It uses vectorization via broadcasting, in other words, it avoids loops.\n",
    "- It's the backbone of other common used Python libraries."
