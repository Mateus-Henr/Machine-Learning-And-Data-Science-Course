    "\n",
    "Machine Learning algorithms are also called models.\n",
    "They differ from normal algorithms once normal algorithms start with an input and a recipe to follow to get to a specific output, however when it comes to Machine Learning algorithms it starts with input and an ideal output to get to the recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Analysis vs Data Science\n",
    "Data Analysis consists in analysing a set of data in order to get a better understanding of the data.\n",
    "Meanwhile, Machine Learning bases itself off in looking at data and finding patterns in it.\n",
    "Data Science is both of them together."
