Machine Learning algorithms are also called models.
They differ from normal algorithms once normal algorithms start with an input and a recipe to follow to get to a specific output, however when it comes to machine learning algorithms it starts with input and an ideal output to get to the recipe.

Data analysis vs Data Science
Data analysis consists in analysing a set of data in order to get a better understanding of the data.
Meanwhile, machine lerning bases itself off in looking at data and finding patterns in it.
Data science is both of them together.
