    "## When You Shouldn't Use Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- When an imperative programming code is enough to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning:** There's data and labels. The machine essentially attempts to guess the label. It repeats the process of guessing and improving itself at each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification:** Identifying if it's one thing or another. Guessing a dog breed for instance.\n",
    "     - **Binary classification** - Two options.\n",
    "     - **Multi-class classfication** - More than two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression:** Trying to predict a number. Stock market prediction is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unsupervised Learning:** There is data but no label. It watches out for patterns in order to classify items. Recomendation problems fit into this box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transfer Learning:** This is when we train an already existing machine learning algorithm to change its target.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning:** This is based on trying and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Always match Your problem to the most preferable type of machine learning.\n",
    "- **Supervised learning:** When you know the inputs and outputs.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning:** When you have inputs.\n",
    "- **Transfer learning:** Problem similar to an already existing one."
