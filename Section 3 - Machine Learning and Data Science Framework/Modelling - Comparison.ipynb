    "This happens in the last split of machine learning, the test data split. For testing, we usually give the algorithm, data sets that it has never seen before and analyse it. It's not uncommon to see a slightly difference in performance between the training set and the test set, however if this difference is too wide, then there's a problem. They are called:\n",
    "- **Underfitting:** Occurs when the machine learning algorithm does not fit so well to the training data, that it does not generalize well to the testing data. Like it is taking some wild guesses.\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** Occurs when the machine learning algorithm fits so closely to the training data, that it does not generalize well to the testing data. Like it memorized.\n",

    "- **Data leakage:** This is when the raining data leaks to the test data (overfitting usually).\n",
