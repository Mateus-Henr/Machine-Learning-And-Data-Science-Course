24. Modelling - Picking the Model
Structured Data - Decision trees like CatBost or dmlc XGBoost are options.
Unstructured Data - Deep learning and transfer learning are what to go for.

Training a model - You will be lining up the inputs and outputs, using that data to predict the labels.
Goal: Minimise time between experiments.
