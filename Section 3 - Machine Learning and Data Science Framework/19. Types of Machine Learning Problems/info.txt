When you shouldn't use machine learning
	â€¢ When an imperative programming code is enough to solve the problem.

Main types of machine learning
Supervised learning - There's data and labels. The machine essentially attempts to guess the label. It repeats the process of guessing and improving itself at each time.

Classification - Identifying if it's one thing or another. Guessing a dog breed for instance.
	Binary classification - Two options.
	Multi-class classfication - More than two options.
	
Regression - Trying to predict a number. Stock market prediction is an example.


Unsupervised learning - There is data but no label. It watches out for patterns in order to classify items. Recomendation problems fit into this box.

Transfer learning - This is when we train an already existing machine learning algorithm to change its target.

Reinforcement learning - This is based on trying and error.

Conclusion
Always match Your problem to the most preferable type of machine learning.
Supervised learning - When you know the inputs and outputs.
Unsupervised learning - When you have inputs.
Transfer learning - Problem similar to an already existing one.
